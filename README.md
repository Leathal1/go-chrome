# go-chrome

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mkenney/go-chrome)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mkenney/go-chrome) This package aims to be a complete [Chrome DevTools Protocol Viewer](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) implementation. My primary use-case is interacting with [headless Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) in a container environment, but this should be appropriate for developing server side and desktop applications as well.

(WIP, should probably ignore this for now)
